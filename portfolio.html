	<h2>About projects and interests</h2>
	<p>
	I've worked as a language teacher for several years
	(Swedish, English and German). Now I work as a trainer in
	different projects. I mostly help unemployed people with
	their job search and career planning. I myself aim at 
	working in a company and helping their personnel achieve
	their goals.
