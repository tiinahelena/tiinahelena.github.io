		<p>I'm an ethusiastic learner who wants to bring joy 		to learning and coaching. I'm at my best when giving
		a speech in front of an audience, having a 
		discussion with one or more people or concentrating 
		by myself on a task, whether it is a mathematical
		problem, planning, writing or creating. For me the
		Finnish countryside is a place where I can always			feel at home. Nature, people and animals are all
		close to my heart. Do you feel the same?
